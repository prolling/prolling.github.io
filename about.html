                                        During the summer of 2020, one of my friends and I saw an 
                                        issue in our small town. We saw that many small businesses 
                                        were struggling to market themselves online. With COVID-19,
                                        it was more important than ever for them to market themselves, 
                                        and we saw a way that we could help them. We created our business,
                                        Clear Lake Connected, to be a social media marketing provider
                                        for these businesses. Since our start, we have made over 
                                        $7000 in profit, and much more through winning the 2020 NIACC YEA pitch
                                        competition, and getting through the qualifying round for the 
                                        2021 NIACC College Pitch off compeition. Use the button below to

                                        WiSE, or Women in Science and Engineering, is a program at Iowa State
                                        that supports women in STEM majors by inspiring, supporting, and empowering current
                                        and future students to persist in their STEM majors. During the spring 2022 
                                        semester, I worked as the social media intern and as an SRM.
                                        As the social media intern, I generated, created, and pushed out social media content as well
                                        as working with a variety of teams. As an SRM, or Student Role Model, I traveled to 
                                        various schools/events around Iowa to do activities with kids there with the 
                                        intention of facilitating a love of STEM. Although I do not currently work in the WiSE office, I am
                                        still a very active participant in the program.
